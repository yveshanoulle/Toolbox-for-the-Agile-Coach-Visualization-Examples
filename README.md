The project with the original text.

This README contains the global proposals. 

The idea is to do the translation page per page. To show to others you will work on a page, you add your name to the page and commit to github. Please only one page at the time. When you are finished you can commit your translation and remove your name. (And start a new page if you feel like it...)

When you are ready, you change the name of the file to page_xxx.txt F. ex. page1.txt changes to page_0_001.txt That way the pages at the top are also the pages not yet done.

After teh first review we change that same page to page_1_001.txt After a second review page_2_001.txt etc

To make the life of the reviewers easier, we keep the English text below the translated text. When you have added a translation or did a review, please add your name to page122.txt

We start by translating a_glossary, to have a list of typical translation. This list was created by previous translations, when we need other words, we can add them.
