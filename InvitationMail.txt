hi < NAME>

Bonjour mes amis Français (I don't need an accent circonflex in this word, do I  ;-) (sorry I could not resist)

I'm continue in English as you know I can speak and read French, yet I'm bad with French writing and exactly for that I want your help.

Do you know the book from my friend Jimmy Janlen?
http://leanpub.com/agiletoolbox-visualizationexamples

I personally think it's the best book of 2015
I liked it so much I gave him examples when he publicly wrote it. That makes me of course very biased.

yet I put my money where my mouth is and I decided last week that it would be handy to have a Dutch version. I looked for a community to translate the book in Dutch.

euh Yves what has this todo with me, I'm French speaking?
right. Well I learned about book translation from some of the great work you or your friends did. And I assume that when a book is wurth to translate in Dutch, it’s for sure worth to translate it in French.

I promised Jimmy I would not start to ask for other languages until we have finished the translation in Dutch.

I created a github project with one file per page for Dutch last Friday.
I send out some emails to Dutch and Belgium friends on Saturday.
By Sunday evening we had 18 people helping out and translated 43 pages of the 124 pages.
By Monday we had +30 people on github and 106 pages translated.
On Tuesday evening we had 124 pages translated.

That must have been the fastest translation project I know of.

Ok it's possible because all the pages are independent and are only a few paragraphs.
so I challenge the French agile community that is so good at translating books, if you can beat this.

I already created the github project.

I already created a mailing list to discuss.

the proces we used for the NL project is in the readme file.

Are you ready for the challenge?
