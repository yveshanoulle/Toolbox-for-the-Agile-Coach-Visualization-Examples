hi <name>,

Welcome.
Thank you to collaborate. 

We work with github.
https://github.com/yveshanoulle/Toolbox-for-the-Agile-Coach-Visualization-Examples-FR

When you send your github account to me, I will add you to the translation project.

Our way of working is inspired by open source and it's communities.
That looks more like controlled chaos then it looks like teamwork.

All the pages of the book are uploaded as a seperate page.
We don't discuss before who works on what file.

To avoid that multiple people work on the same file, we are going to work-out-loud. That is when we start on a file, we let our communiy know. What better place to let someone know on a file, then in the file itself. 
You put your name inside the file you want to translate and you commit that change to github.

Please only put your name in one file at the time.
(To avoid you block many files from being translated by otehr community members.)

When you are ready with the translation of that file, you remove your name out of the file. 
You change the name of the file as explained in the readme file.

We have a glossary for hard and words that are common. To make sure we have a uniform language.
We also have a mailing list and we use that to communicate.

The drawings of the book we won't translate for now.
The translated book will be sold on leanpub. 



Yves
